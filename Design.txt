Input >>
Get Dimensions (Width x Height)
Get seed start information (Center, Random, Modular)
Get rule [0, 255]
Get output file name
Get path

Process >>
# byte array elements will take values on [0, 255]
Create byte array of dimension w x 1
    Populate with seed

Use rule to populate remaining bytes F(r, c)
    Read element (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r-1, c+1)
    If r-1 || r+1 are out of bounds, assume empty
    Iterate from r = 1 > r = Height

    Apply F(r, c) to current cell

Output >>
    Use image write to build png
